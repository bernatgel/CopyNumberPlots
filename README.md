# CopyNumberPlots - An R package to plot genomic copy number data using karyoploteR


## Description

This is the initial work on a simple package to create plots of genomic copy number data using karyoploteR. Is is specially useful for SNP-array data, but can be used for other types of copy number calling technologies.

The basic functionality is in place, but things are evolving and the package is growing according to my own needs. No documentation still available (although the usage should be easy to grasp for anyone with experience with [karyoploteR](https://github.com/bernatgel/karyoploteR)).

## How to use it

To use it you need to install it in your system. You can use [devtools::install_github](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/devtools/versions/1.13.6/topics/install_github)

    library(devtools)
    install_github("bernatgel/CopyNumberPlots")
